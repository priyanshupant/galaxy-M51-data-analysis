# Explorotary Data Analysis on Whirlpool Galaxy (M51)

This repository contains code and data for the analysis of the Whirlpool Galaxy (M51) and its companion galaxy, NGC 5195. The project explores the gravitational interactions between these galaxies, focusing on morphological distortions in the spiral arms of M51.

## Overview

- **Galaxy**: Messier 51a (M51a) or NGC 5194, "The Whirlpool Galaxy"
- **Companion Galaxy**: NGC 5195
- **Constellation**: Canes Venatici
- **Distance from Earth**: Approximately 23 million light-years
- **Analysis Focus**: Morphological distortions in M51's spiral arms due to gravitational interaction with NGC 5195

## Hypothesis Testing

The primary hypothesis tested in this project is that the spiral arms of M51, particularly those facing NGC 5195, exhibit more pronounced morphological distortions due to gravitational interaction.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Astropy
- scikit-image


## Dataset: 
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/brsdincer/center-of-all-observable-galaxiesfits-allesa

## Image Processing
The analysis involves various image processing techniques, including median filtering, Sobel filtering, Meijering filtering, and Hessian filtering, to highlight morphological features and gravitational interactions.

## Results
The project's findings support the hypothesis, revealing dynamic changes in the morphology of M51's spiral arms influenced by the gravitational forces from NGC 5195.
